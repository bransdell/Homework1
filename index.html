				<h2> About Me </h2>

					<p>I hail from the small town of Bristol, ME. I moved to Iowa over the
					summer of 2009 for what I thought would be a change of pace. Little did
					I know that Iowa was very similar to Maine other than the fact that there
					wasn't any ocean. </p>
					
					<p>I took a year off from school after I graduated from High School so that I
					could save up some money for college tuition. US Cellular hired me as a
					Customer Service Representative and I worked there for the better part of
					a year. I saved up just enough money so that I could pay for my tuition
					and buy a new car. I've been broke ever since my car became my addiction.</p>
					<br/>
			
					<h3>Me in a Nutshell:</h3>
			
			
						<ul>
							<li>First &amp; foremost, I spend the majority of my time working on my car,</li>
							<li>I really enjoy working with computer hardware &amp; software,</li>
							<li>I ride my bike a lot because it's more enjoyable exercise than running,</li>
							<li>I geek out when anyone starts talking about car audio,</li>
							<li>I used to work at a hardware store so I consider myself pretty handy.</li>
						</ul>
			
					<h3>Recent Projects:</h3>
			
						<ul>
							<li>I built a fully customized sound system in my car over the course of this year- 11 speakers, 
							3 amps, 2 processors, 0 guage wire, iPhone &amp; bluetooth intigration, custom fiberglass 
							enclousure, the works.</li>
							<li>I took the time to learn how to buit a computer this summer, ordered my parts online
							from <a href="http://www.newegg.com">newegg</a>, and built a gigantic Ubuntu home server for 
							hosting my media collection.</li>
							<li>I decided it'd be a good idea to take 19 credit hours AND keep a part time job at
							Rockwell Collins. Considering how difficult this has become, I classify this painstaking
							effort: Project Graduation.</li>
